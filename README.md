A lightweight plugin that auto-populates an image's caption and alt text fields with its IPTC caption. It was originally build for http://artwolfe.com

IPTC Caption Mapping is now in WordPress Core. Just keeping this plugin for historical purposes.

== Description ==

A lightweight plugin that auto-populates an image's caption and alternative text fields with its IPTC caption if it's available on upload (default WP behaviour populates the image description field only). You may not want to auto populate all the field with the same content, but for an example this is what you can do.
